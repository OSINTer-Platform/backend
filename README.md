## What is OSINTbackend?
OSINTbackend is responsible for acting as a collection of scripts, written to
utilize [OSINTmodules](https://gitlab.com/osinter/modules) to scrape
modern news sites, and store the information in a standardized and managable
form. It allows for collecting large amounts of information, while still being
secure and scalable and not containing much boiler-plate code.
